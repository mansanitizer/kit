# Welcome to Kit 1.0

> **"The future is just the past, recompiled."**

Welcome, User. You have successfully booted into **Kit** — the first operating system generated entirely by Intelligence.

---

## 💾 What is this place?
This looks like 1998, but it's not. 
There is no hard drive here. There is no CPU executing pre-written binaries.

**Everything you see is a AI generated.** 
Every app, every window, and every tool is being generated in real-time by an Artificial Intelligence, structured strictly by data contracts.

## ⚡ How to use Kit
The core loop is simple:
1.  **Open the Tool Forge**: The "Start Menu" of this world.
2.  **Describe a Tool**: Just say "I want a calorie counter" or "I want a PDF summarizer".
3.  **Watch it Build**: Kit creates the interface, logic, and database schema instantly.

## 🛠️ Hero Tools to Try
Double-click these icons on your desktop to start:

- **🍎 Food Lens**: Drag and drop a photo of your lunch. Kit will calculate the macros.
- **📄 CV Fixer**: Upload your resume. Kit will rewrite it for FAANG/Manga companies.


## 🧠 Your Memory
Kit remembers.
As you use tools, Kit builds a **User Profile** of you. It learns your dietary preferences, your job history, and your writing style. 
The more you use it, the more it becomes *yours*.
